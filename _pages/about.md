I'm now pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), under the supervision of Prof. [Xiang-Yang Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xiangyangli/)((ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow)). 
I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Security from USTC in 2023. My research interests include IoT security and privacy. I welcome collaboration and discussions via email.
