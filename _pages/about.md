I'm currently a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by Prof. [Xiang-Yang Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xiangyangli/) (ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow). I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Security from USTC in 2023. My research interests include IoT security and privacy. Feel free to reach out to me via email for collaboration or discussion.
